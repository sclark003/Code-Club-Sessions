# Code-Club-Sessions
Sessions run at a local school code club using BBC Microbits, Smart Cutebot robots, Arcade game consoles, and Python programming. 

---

## **Learning Goals**
- Introduce students to programming concepts, e.g. variables, booleans, conditionals, loops
- Introduce students to programmable features of BBC microbits, e.g. LEDs, sensors, accelerometer
- Introduce students to robotics with Cutebot, e.g. movement control, line following, obstacle avoidance
- Introduce students to game development with Arcade console, e.g. sprites, animation, scoring, game mechanics
- Introduce students to advanced game development, e.g. game design, power-ups, boss battles, level systems, game polish
- Introduce students to Python programming, e.g. variables, functions, file handling, object-oriented programming, data visualisation
- Encourage students to think beyond sessions and independently add new features based on the content presented
- Have fun!
