# Code-Club-Sessions
Sessions run at a local school code club using BBC Microbits and a Smart Cutebot. 

---

## **Learning Goals**
- Introduce students to programming concepts, e.g. variables, booleans, conditionals, loops
- Introduce students to programmable features of BBC microbits, e.g. LEDs, sensors, accelerometer
- Introduce students to robotics with Cutebot, e.g. movement control, line following, obstacle avoidance
- Encourage students to think beyond sessions and independently add new features based on the content presented
- Have fun!
